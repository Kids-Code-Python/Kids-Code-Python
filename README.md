# What is KCP?
Kids Code Python is a group of teachers and learners helping to teach kids python. Besides teaching python, KCP also works on creating tools that help with python coding or research. We also work on python projects together and share ideas with each other.

# An important note
You don't need to be an adult to teach python. You can be a kid with a passion for it. Or someone who wants to help spread knowledge. Please question yourself on one aspect when becoming a teacher:
